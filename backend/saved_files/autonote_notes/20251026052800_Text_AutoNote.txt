=== Transcript ===
Python is a popular, high-level, general-purpose programming language. üêç It's famous for its clean, easy-to-read syntax that emphasizes readability, making it a favorite for beginners and experts alike.


Key Features
Beginner-Friendly: Its simple, English-like syntax means you can write and understand programs relatively quickly. It uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, which forces clean formatting.


Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter. This makes debugging easier, as you can often see errors immediately rather than having to compile the entire program first.


Versatile: It's a "general-purpose" language, meaning it's not locked into one specific task. You can use it for a huge variety of applications.


Massive Ecosystem: Python has a large standard library ("batteries included") that provides tools for many common tasks. It also has a huge community that contributes millions of third-party packages (libraries) for specialized jobs, like data analysis or web development.

Free and Open-Source: It costs nothing to download, use, or share.

What is Python Used For?
Python's versatility means it shows up everywhere. Some of its most popular uses include:

Data Science & Machine Learning: This is one of its biggest strengths. Libraries like Pandas (for data analysis), NumPy (for numerical operations), and TensorFlow or PyTorch (for AI and machine learning) make it the go-to language for data professionals
