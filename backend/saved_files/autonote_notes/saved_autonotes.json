    "transcript": "Python is a popular, high-level, and general-purpose programming language. üêç It's known for its simple, easy-to-read syntax, which often resembles plain English. This design philosophy emphasizes code readability, allowing programmers to express complex ideas in fewer lines of code than many other languages.\n\n\nIt's an interpreted language, which means the code is executed line by line, making it easier to debug and excellent for rapid development.\n\nKey Features\nEasy to Learn & Use: Its straightforward syntax makes it an outstanding choice for beginners.\n\nLarge Standard Library: It comes with a vast library of pre-written code (modules) for common tasks, so you don't have to build everything from scratch.\n\nVast Ecosystem: Beyond the standard library, Python has a massive collection of third-party packages (like pip, its package manager) for specialized tasks.\n\nCross-Platform: Python code can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems without modification.\n\nFree and Open-Source: It's completely free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes, and its development is managed by a large community.\n\nCommon Uses\nPython's versatility makes it a powerful tool in many different fields:\n\nWeb Development: Building the server-side (backend) of websites using frameworks like Django and Flask.\n\nData Science & Machine Learning: Analyzing data, creating visualizations, and building artificial intelligence (AI) models. This is one of its most popular uses, powered by libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.",
