It uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, which forces clean formatting.\n\n\nInterpreted: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter. This makes debugging easier, as you can often see errors immediately rather than having to compile the entire program first.\n\n\nVersatile: It's a \"general-purpose\" language, meaning it's not locked into one specific task. You can use it for a huge variety of applications.\n\n\nMassive Ecosystem: Python has a large standard library (\"batteries included\") that provides tools for many common tasks. It also has a huge community that contributes millions of third-party packages (libraries) for specialized jobs, like data analysis or web development.\n\nFree and Open-Source: It costs nothing to download, use, or share.\n\nWhat is Python Used For?\nPython's versatility means it shows up everywhere. Some of its most popular uses include:\n\nData Science & Machine Learning: This is one of its biggest strengths.
